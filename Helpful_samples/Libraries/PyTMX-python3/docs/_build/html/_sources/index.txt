Introduction
_______________________________________________________________________________

This map loader can be used to load maps created in the Tiled Map Editor.  It
provides a simple way to get tile images and associated metadata so that you
can draw a map onto the screen and do useful things with metadata.

PyTMX strives to balance performance, flexibility, and performance.  Feel free
to use the classes provided in pytmx.py as superclasses to your own maps, or
simply load the data with PyTMX and copy the data into your own classes with
the simple api.

I've included a test suite and demo in the 'tests' folder.  It should work
across all platforms.  test.py demonstrates loading a variety of maps and
formats, and demo.py shows how you can create scrolling maps in a very simple
fashion, while still retaining all the power of the Tiled Editor.
